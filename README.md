# interactive_movie

React app for playing interactive movies with choice of what happens e.g "Bandersnatch". Videos must be on YouTube.

## Developing

Run `npm start`

## Deployment with your own videos

For that you need to change `interactive-movie/src/data/videos.json` and then run `npm run build`.
Will be better in the future I hope.
